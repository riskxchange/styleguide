```

## Usage (Vanilla JS)

Use the RawGit CDN to access these files in your project.

**Javascript:**

```

```
https://rawgit.com/riskxchange/styleguide/__VERSION__/dist/main.css
```

## Usage (React)

Import the components like so:

## What to edit

You should only need to edit files in the `src` directory.

Files in `dist`, `react` and `docs` are generated by the `npm run build` command.
